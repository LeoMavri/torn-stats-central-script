# TSC Companion NEXT

This is the _next_ version of the TSC Companion script. It's a significant rewrite of the original script, with a lot of new features and improvements.

The style is somewhat inconsistent, but I'm pushing this out to:

1. Get feedback on the new features
2. Lessen the strain on the backend server as this is _a lot_ more efficient than the original script

## How-to

1. Install Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey (or any other userscript manager, however Tampermonkey is recommended)
2. Install the script by clicking [here](https://github.com/LeoMavri/TSC-Companion/raw/next/dist/tsc-companion.user.js)
3. Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eegQhTUqPS) and use `/register` (in any channel) to register with your API key of choice (Limited or higher required). Make sure you don't leak your API key :P
4. On your profle page, you should see a black bar with `TSC` written on it. Click on it to open the settings menu. ![It should look like this.](https://i.imgur.com/R5SkM8c.png)
5. Fill in your API key (_that you signed up to TSC with_) and turn on the features you want to use

If you're a PDA user, there's a tutorial [here](https://discord.com/channels/1003653550418706513/1212158284996542494/1212158328319508532). I'm aware the video links are dead, they will be fixed soon.
